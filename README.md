# Java-Simple-Banking-Application
a simple banking application i coded in Java. This is my first Java project!

the real code is in the .java file

the .class files are just there if you're not interested in seeing the code but just the results

to compile the .java file, you must have Java installed on your computer(obviously) and in your console(a.k.a terminal a.k.a command prompt) type in the command:

javac (fileName).java

after that, you can execute the .class files that are made by using the following command in your console:

java (fileName)  Note: no need to add the .class extension

once you do that, the program should start running and you're good to go!
